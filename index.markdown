Hello! 

I am a BTech - MTech Dual Degree student in the [Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering](https://www.iitk.ac.in/bsbe/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in). I am currently investigating the relationship among personality traits, social interaction and reward-based decision making in young adults with [Arjun Ramakrishnan](https://sites.google.com/view/decisionlabiitk/team/arjun?authuser=0).

You can read more about me [here](https://sites.google.com/view/decisionlabiitk/team/akhilesh-tayade?authuser=0).
